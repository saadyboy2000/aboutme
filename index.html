    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Greetings! My name is Saad. I am a full stack developer with an MS in computer information security. </p>

    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>I am a web developer and a lifelong tech learner. I love diving into the complexities of various programming languages. I am just as comfortable working on the back-end as the front-end. It feels like a super power to be able to create applications that make peopleâ€™s lives easier. I love to produce intuitive easy- to-use software that users can keep coming back to. 

    </p>

    <p>

    When I am not developing software, you can find me walking my dogs, traveling the world with my wife, or listening to NPR. I am not afraid of learning new things, so you can always find me in either a new workout or academic class throughout the year.
